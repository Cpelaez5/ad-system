# Netlify redirects for Single Page Application (SPA)
# This file tells Netlify to serve index.html for all routes
# so that Vue Router can handle client-side routing

# Redirect all routes to index.html with 200 status
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: Handle specific API routes if you have a backend
# /api/*  https://your-backend-url.com/api/:splat  200
